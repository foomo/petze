# Petze

**Petze monitors web sites and services**. It exports [prometheus.io](https://promtheus.io) metrics and writes a [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) log.

One instance of petze is designed to monitor many services at little cost.

# Motivation

While there is a vast amount of monitoring solutions out there I still felt there was somthing simplistic missing, that would play nicely with [prometheus.io](https://promtheus.io), which I have come to appreciate very much.

# Status

As of June 2017 we have a first working version and we are trying to get the configs right - feedback is most welcome.

# Configuration

Petze is configured through a set of yaml configuration files. The config folder name can be passed to petze, if not it will look for the configuration in 

## Configuration layout

Petze is configured from files in a configuration folder.

## Main config file petze.yml

```yaml
# 
# optional http address if you want to run without tls
address: server-name.net:8080
# running on tls
tls:
  address: server-name:8443
  cert: path/to/cert.pem
  key: path/to/key.pem
# optional basic auth
basicauthfile: path/to/basic-auth-file

```

## Service configurations

Any other files with a .yml suffix will be treated as service configurations. It is strongly encouraged to organize them in folder structures. These will be refected in the service ids.
